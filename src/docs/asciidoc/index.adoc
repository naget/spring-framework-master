The Spring Framework is a lightweight solution and a potential one-stop-shop for
building your enterprise-ready applications. However, Spring is modular, allowing you to
use only those parts that you need, without having to bring in the rest. You can use the
IoC container, with any web framework on top, but you can also use only the
<<data-access.adoc#orm-hibernate,Hibernate integration code>> or the
<<data-access.adoc#jdbc-introduction,JDBC abstraction layer>>. The Spring Framework supports declarative
transaction management, remote access to your logic through RMI or web services, and various
options for persisting your data.
It offers full-featured web frameworks such as <<web.adoc#mvc-introduction,Spring MVC>>
and <<web.adoc#web-reactive, Spring WebFlux>>; and it enables you to
integrate <<core.adoc#aop-introduction,AOP>> transparently into your software.

This document is a reference guide to Spring Framework features. Questions on the
Framework itself should be asked on StackOverflow (see https://spring.io/questions[]).
